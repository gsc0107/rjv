some bioinformatics related python scripts and libraries

Not all of these scripts are complete or functional. I mainly use the generator functions for retrieving the next fasta or fastq record from a file.

If starting a new project you may be better off looking at biopython or other libraries, these are simply what I used in my personal scripts.
